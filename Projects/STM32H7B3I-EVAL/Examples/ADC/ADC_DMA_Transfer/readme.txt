@par Example Description 

How to configure and use the ADC to convert an external analog input and get 
the result using a DMA transfer through the HAL API.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H7B3XXQ Devices :
The CPU at 280 MHz.
The HCLK for CD Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals, CD Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and SRD Domain AHB4 peripherals at 280 MHz.
The APB clock dividers for CD Domain APB3 peripherals, CD Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and SRD Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 280 MHz/2.

The ADC is configured to continuously convert ADC_CHANNEL_0, resolution is set to 16 bits right aligned, conversion is software-triggered.

DMA1_Stream1 is configured in Circular mode to transfer continuously
the content of ADC_DR (Data Register) to "aADCxConvertedData" variable which 
stores the conversion result.

User may watch variable array "aADCxConvertedData" and check that its value is modified
according to the voltage applied to PA.0C, directly controlled by
the Eval Board potentiometer (RV1).

STM32 board LED can be used to monitor the conversion:
  - LED2 is ON when there is an error in initialization.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex M7 and the MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA (or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : CD AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters (DMAs, DMA2D, LTDC, MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
              Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
              Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series and STM32H7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H7B3xxQ devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32H7B3I-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32H7B3I-EVAL Set-up
    Make sure JP5 is plugged in position POTPA0_C.

  - To monitor the conversion result, put the "aADCxConvertedData" variable in the debugger live watch.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
